\section{Introduction}
Among those who discouraged a literalist approach to scripture 
interpretation was Baha'u'llah Himself. I am posting my provisional 
translation of Baha'u'llah's "Commentary on the Surah of the Sun" along 
with a brief introduction, in an effort to open up the discussion. The 
translation is only provisional; an earlier version of it was kindly 
published by the preeminent Baha'i scholar Stephen Lambden in his *Baha'i 
Studies Bulletin*, under the auspices of the NSA of the UK; I think the 
translation is good enough to form the basis of some discussions here, 
but the friends should please remember that it is provisional.
